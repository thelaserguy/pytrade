# Hi! I'm PyTrader!

**I have very clear directives. It's nice to know my purpose.** 

> *fulfilling my purpose is something entirely different*



#### Things ~~I'd like~~  I NEED to do ASAP:
 - [ ] Aggregate historical & current stock data 
 - [ ] Analyze the data using traditional & statistical algorithms 
 - [ ] Graph & plot the actual vs predicted closing prices & other such data
 - [ ] Offer a risk assessment based on above data
 - [ ] Package all of the above & display it using Flask
---
### Maybe one day; just not today.
##### Gotta walk before you run, ammirite? 

#### Eventually, I'd like to be able to:
 - [ ] Calculate & factor other variables, such as sentiment & expectations
 - [ ] Work outside of the browser
 - [ ] Include crypto currency
 - [ ] Include an area for user input of symbols
 - [ ] Use machine learning to make better predictions
---
##### I'll figure this out... Sooner or later.
